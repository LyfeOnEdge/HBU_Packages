    "description": "Host your Switch media over LAN.\\nScreenshots\\nVideos\\nAnd SDCard Contents\\n\\nSwitch Media Host is a simple python script that allows you to see your Switch screenshots, video clips, and all of your SDCard contents directly from your browser! Note: You need to be on the same network as the Switch in order to see your files. This allows for easier transfering, with a simple and clean design.\\n\\nIt achieves this by hosting a local webserver directly from the Switch, and then the script adjusts the webpage to fit your system accordingly!\\n\\nYour Switch must have access to homebrew.\\n\\nMore info here :\\n\\nhttps://github.com/ImmaSpoon/Switch-Media-Host\\n",

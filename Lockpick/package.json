    "description": "Lockpick is a ground-up C++17 rewrite of homebrew key derivation software, namely kezplez-nx. It also dumps titlekeys. This will dump all keys through *_key_05 on firmwares below 6.2.0 and through *_key_06 on 6.2.0.\n\nDue to key generation changes introduced in 7.0.0, Lockpick is not able to dump keys ending in 07 at all. Furthermore, unfortunately the public method to dump tsec_root_key is only available on firmware 6.2.0 so 7.x consoles can only dump through keys ending in 05.",

    "description": "Introduction\\nSlitherlink is a logic puzzle game created in 1989 by Japanese publisher Nikoli, famous for creating Sudoku, among many other puzzle games. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink for more info.\\n\\nI discovered the game a few years ago on the Nintendo DS with 'Puzzle Series Vol. 5: Slitherlink', which was never released outside of Japan. It's such a good game I became addicted to it, just like with Picross and Nurikabe.\\n\\nThis is my version of the game for the Nintendo Switch. It's a rewrite of one of my previous projects for the Dingoo A320. It features 456 levels in four sizes: 5x5 (easy), 7x7, 10x10, 20x20 (hard). There's also a save state function, undo button, and more.\\n\\nRules\\nIn SlitherlinkNX, you draw lines on a grid to create a meandering path, following the rules:\\n\\nThe path must form a single loop, without crossing itself or branching.\\nThe numbers indicate how many lines surround each cell. Empty cells may be surrounded by any number of lines.\\nThere is one unique solution for each level. You can draw small x's on segments that cannot be connected. You should be able to find the solution by logical deduction only, without guessing.\\n\\nFor Slitherlink beginners, I strongly recommend to consult the Wikipedia page, especially chapter 'Solution methods', which is a big help at the start: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slitherlink#Solution_methods\\n\\nControls\\nd-pad: move cursor\\nX/A/B/Y: draw a line, then a cross, then nothing, in the corresponding direction\\nL + X/A/B/Y: draw a cross, then a line, then nothing, in the corresponding direction\\nR: undo previous action\\n+: open menu, allowing to: retry, save state, or quit\\n\\nCredits\\nDevelopment: Tardigrade (http://beyondds.free.fr/)\\nOriginal game: Nikoli (http://www.nikoli.com/)\\nPuzzles: Krazydad (http://www.krazydad.com/slitherlink/)\\nFont: Chopin Script\\nSounds: Junggle\\nBackground: aopsan",

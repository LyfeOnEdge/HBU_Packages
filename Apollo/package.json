Its goal is to be the most convenient and reliable method to manage console's files.\n\nApollo's current features are:\n-Graphical User Interface: Minimalist design which is based on default hbmenu and official home menu esthetic.\n-Selecting items: A simple but mandatory feature.\n-Copying files and directories: Before doing so, application checks whether user is trying to overwrite currently existing files or directories and then asks about overwriting them.\n-Recursive directory deletion: It allows for complete deletion of directories' content and obviously for file deletion.\n-Renaming files and directories: Speaks for itself.\n-Sorting items: Alphabetically or reversed.\n\nCredits:\ndevkitPro for providing toolchain.\nXorTroll for the amazing Plutonium which allowed Apollo to look like this and the Goldleaf which is a mine of knowledge.\nGilFerraz for his beautiful Miiverse UI concept which inspired me to create sidebar.\nLucas Lacerda for his Nintendo Switch UI Concept.\njaames for the nx-hbmenu mockup which helped me with the design.\nNintendo for security <3.\n",
